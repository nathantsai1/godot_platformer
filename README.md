#Godot_platformer
## What is this?

This is a platformer game based off of a godot tutorial(I changed the different size, platform, and sprites), and simply moves the character left, right and down.

## How do I use this?

use the left arrow, right arrow, and space for jumping

## How difficult was it?

Pretty simple, though I did realize that it is very difficult to set up
